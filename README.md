### Responsive-Travel-Website-using-HTML-CSS-and-JS

This travel website called Travel.Lah. My goal for making this website because i want to introduce the best tourism destinations in Indonesia to all of the traveller over the world. So that they will be interested to have a tour in Indonesia with their friends or family.

This website contains several sections such as :
<ul>
  <li>header</li>
</ul>, main content, aside and footer. The main content consists of About us, Website advantages, Tour, and Reviews Sections. I didn't not only make this website on desktop screen, but also on mobile screen without using any framework, which is good to train your HTML, CSS and JS skills.
