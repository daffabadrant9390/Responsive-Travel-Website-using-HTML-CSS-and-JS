### Responsive-Travel-Website-using-HTML-CSS-and-JS

This travel website called Travel.Lah. It is a website which contain several sections such as, header, content and footer. The content consists of About us section, Website advantages section, Tour section, and Reviews Section. I didn't not only make this website on desktop screen, but also on mobile screen without using any framework, which is good to train your HTML, CSS and JS skills. I'm quite new at JS and CSS animation, so that some animations were not very good.

If you guys want to repair that to make the website better, feel free to modify it. Thank you!
