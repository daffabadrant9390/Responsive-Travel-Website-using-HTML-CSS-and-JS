## Responsive-Travel-Website-using-HTML-CSS-and-JS

This travel website called <strong>Travel.Lah</strong>. My goal for making this website because i want to introduce the best tourism destinations in Indonesia to all of the traveller over the world. So that they will be interested to have a tour in Indonesia with their friends or family.

This website contains several sections such as :
<ul>
  <li>Header
    <ul>
      <li>Logo</li>
      <li>Navbar</li>
      <li>Jumbotron</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Main Content
    <ul>
      <li>About Us</li>
      <li>Website Adventages</li>
      <li>Tour Packages</li>
      <li>Reviews</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aside</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
</ul> 

I didn't not only make this website on desktop screen, but also on mobile screen without using any framework. For styling i was only using CSS Flexbox
